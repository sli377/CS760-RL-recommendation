In this study, we implement a SlateQ model based on the classical SlateQ framework, incorporating a Two-Tower architecture to separately encode user and business features, with their interaction modeled via inner product scoring. This dual-tower design is inspired by the original SlateQ paper's approach of modeling user states and item actions independently, allowing for efficient handling of large-scale candidate sets. Additionally, we introduce several innovations, such as removing the explicit click probability modeling and replacing the original combinatorial optimization with a simplified Top-K approximation, significantly reducing model complexity. These modifications make our model particularly well-suited for the Yelp dataset scenario, where feature dimensions are relatively low and user-business interactions are sparse, thus enhancing both practicality and deployment efficiency.
